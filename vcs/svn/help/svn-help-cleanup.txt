cleanup: Either recover from an interrupted operation that left the working
copy locked, or remove unwanted files.
usage: 1. cleanup [WCPATH...]
       2. cleanup --remove-unversioned [WCPATH...]
          cleanup --remove-ignored [WCPATH...]
       3. cleanup --vacuum-pristines [WCPATH...]

  1. When none of the options --remove-unversioned, --remove-ignored, and
    --vacuum-pristines is specified, remove all write locks (shown as 'L' by
    the 'svn status' command) from the working copy.  Usually, this is only
    necessary if a Subversion client has crashed while using the working copy,
    leaving it in an unusable state.

    WARNING: There is no mechanism that will protect write locks still
             being used by other Subversion clients. Running this command
             without any options while another client is using the working
             copy can corrupt the working copy beyond repair!

  2. If the --remove-unversioned option or the --remove-ignored option
    is given, remove any unversioned or ignored items within WCPATH.
    Note that the 'svn status' command shows unversioned items as '?',
    and ignored items as 'I' if the --no-ignore option is given to it.

  3. If the --vacuum-pristines option is given, remove pristine copies of
    files which are stored inside the .svn directory and which are no longer
    referenced by any file in the working copy.

Valid options:
  --remove-unversioned     : remove unversioned items
  --remove-ignored         : remove ignored items
  --vacuum-pristines       : remove unreferenced pristines from .svn directory
  --include-externals      : also operate on externals defined by
                             svn:externals properties
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  --diff3-cmd ARG          : deprecated and ignored

(Use '-v' to show global and experimental options.)
