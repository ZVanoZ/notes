move (mv, rename, ren): Move (rename) an item in a working copy or repository.
usage: move SRC... DST

  SRC and DST can both be working copy (WC) paths or URLs:
    WC  -> WC:  move an item in a working copy, as a local change to
                be committed later (with or without further changes)
    URL -> URL: move an item in the repository directly, immediately
                creating a new revision in the repository
  All the SRCs must be of the same type. If DST is an existing directory,
  the sources will be added as children of DST. When moving multiple
  sources, DST must be an existing directory.

  SRC and DST of WC -> WC moves must be committed in the same revision.
  Furthermore, WC -> WC moves will refuse to move a mixed-revision subtree.
  To avoid unnecessary conflicts, it is recommended to run 'svn update'
  to update the subtree to a single revision before moving it.
  The --allow-mixed-revisions option is provided for backward compatibility.

Valid options:
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  --force                  : force operation to run
  --parents                : make intermediate directories
  --allow-mixed-revisions  : Allow operation on mixed-revision working copy.
                             Use of this option is not recommended!
                             Please run 'svn update' instead.
  -m [--message] ARG       : specify log message ARG
  -F [--file] ARG          : read log message from file ARG
  --force-log              : force validity of log message source
  --editor-cmd ARG         : use ARG as external editor
  --encoding ARG           : treat value as being in charset encoding ARG
  --with-revprop ARG       : set revision property ARG in new revision
                             using the name[=value] format
  -r [--revision] ARG      : deprecated and ignored

(Use '-v' to show global and experimental options.)
