resolved: Remove 'conflicted' state on working copy files or directories.
usage: resolved PATH...

  Note:  this subcommand does not semantically resolve conflicts or
  remove conflict markers; it merely removes the conflict-related
  artifact files and allows PATH to be committed again.  It has been
  deprecated in favor of running 'svn resolve --accept working'.

Valid options:
  --targets ARG            : pass contents of file ARG as additional args
  -R [--recursive]         : descend recursively, same as --depth=infinity
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                             'immediates', or 'infinity')
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information

(Use '-v' to show global and experimental options.)
