revert: Restore pristine working copy state (undo local changes).
usage: revert PATH...

  Revert changes in the working copy at or within PATH, and remove
  conflict markers as well, if any.

  This subcommand does not revert already committed changes.
  For information about undoing already committed changes, search
  the output of 'svn help merge' for 'undo'.

Valid options:
  --targets ARG            : pass contents of file ARG as additional args
  -R [--recursive]         : descend recursively, same as --depth=infinity
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                             'immediates', or 'infinity')
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  --changelist [--cl] ARG  : operate only on members of changelist ARG
  --remove-added           : reverting an added item will remove it from disk

(Use '-v' to show global and experimental options.)
