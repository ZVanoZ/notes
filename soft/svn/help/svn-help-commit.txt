commit (ci): Send changes from your working copy to the repository.
usage: commit [PATH...]

  A log message must be provided, but it can be empty.  If it is not
  given by a --message or --file option, an editor will be started.

  If any targets are (or contain) locked items, those will be
  unlocked after a successful commit, unless --no-unlock is given.

  If --include-externals is given, also commit file and directory
  externals reached by recursion. Do not commit externals with a
  fixed revision.

Valid options:
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  -N [--non-recursive]     : obsolete; same as --depth=empty
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                             'immediates', or 'infinity')
  --targets ARG            : pass contents of file ARG as additional args
  --no-unlock              : don't unlock the targets
  -m [--message] ARG       : specify log message ARG
  -F [--file] ARG          : read log message from file ARG
  --force-log              : force validity of log message source
  --editor-cmd ARG         : use ARG as external editor
  --encoding ARG           : treat value as being in charset encoding ARG
  --with-revprop ARG       : set revision property ARG in new revision
                             using the name[=value] format
  --changelist [--cl] ARG  : operate only on members of changelist ARG
  --keep-changelists       : don't delete changelists after commit
  --include-externals      : also operate on externals defined by
                             svn:externals properties

(Use '-v' to show global and experimental options.)
