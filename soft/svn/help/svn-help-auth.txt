auth: Manage cached authentication credentials.
usage: 1. svn auth [PATTERN ...]
       2. svn auth --remove PATTERN [PATTERN ...]

  With no arguments, list all cached authentication credentials.
  Authentication credentials include usernames, passwords,
  SSL certificates, and SSL client-certificate passphrases.
  If PATTERN is specified, only list credentials with attributes matching one
  or more patterns. With the --remove option, remove cached authentication
  credentials matching one or more patterns.

  If more than one pattern is specified credentials are considered only if they
  match all specified patterns. Patterns are matched case-sensitively and may
  contain glob wildcards:
    ?      matches any single character
    *      matches a sequence of arbitrary characters
    [abc]  matches any of the characters listed inside the brackets
  Note that wildcards will usually need to be quoted or escaped on the
  command line because many command shells will interfere by trying to
  expand them.

Valid options:
  --remove                 : remove matching authentication credentials
  --show-passwords         : show cached passwords

(Use '-v' to show global and experimental options.)
