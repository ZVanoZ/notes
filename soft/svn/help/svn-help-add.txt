add: Put new files and directories under version control.
usage: add PATH...

  Schedule unversioned PATHs for addition, so they will become versioned and
  be added to the repository in the next commit. Recurse into directories by
  default (see the --depth option).

  The 'svn add' command is only necessary for files and directories that are
  not yet under version control. Unversioned files and directories can be
  identified with 'svn status' (see 'svn help status').

  The effects of 'svn add' can be undone with 'svn revert' before the addition
  has been committed. Once committed, a path can be removed from version
  control with 'svn delete', and in some circumstances by running a reverse-
  merge (see 'svn help merge' for details).

  With --force, add all the unversioned paths found in PATHs and ignore the
  rest; otherwise, error out if any specified paths are already versioned.

  The selection of items to add may be influenced by the 'ignores' feature.
  Properties may be attached to the items as configured by the 'auto-props'
  feature.

Valid options:
  --targets ARG            : pass contents of file ARG as additional args
  -N [--non-recursive]     : obsolete; same as --depth=empty
  --depth ARG              : limit operation by depth ARG ('empty', 'files',
                             'immediates', or 'infinity')
  -q [--quiet]             : print nothing, or only summary information
  --force                  : ignore already versioned paths
  --no-ignore              : disregard default and svn:ignore and
                             svn:global-ignores property ignores
  --auto-props             : enable automatic properties
  --no-auto-props          : disable automatic properties
  --parents                : add intermediate parents

(Use '-v' to show global and experimental options.)
