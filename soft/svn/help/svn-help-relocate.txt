relocate: Relocate the working copy to point to a different repository root URL.
usage: 1. relocate FROM-PREFIX TO-PREFIX [PATH...]
       2. relocate TO-URL [PATH]

  Rewrite working copy URL metadata to reflect a syntactic change only.
  This is used when a repository's root URL changes (such as a scheme
  or hostname change) but your working copy still reflects the same
  directory within the same repository.

  1. FROM-PREFIX and TO-PREFIX are initial substrings of the working
     copy's current and new URLs, respectively.  (You may specify the
     complete old and new URLs if you wish.)  Use 'svn info' to determine
     the current working copy URL.

  2. TO-URL is the (complete) new repository URL to use for PATH.

  Examples:
    svn relocate http:// svn:// project1 project2
    svn relocate http://www.example.com/repo/project \
                 svn://svn.example.com/repo/project

Valid options:
  --ignore-externals       : ignore externals definitions

(Use '-v' to show global and experimental options.)
